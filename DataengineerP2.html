<p>As your organization expands its usage of GCP, many teams have started to create their own projects. Projects are further multiplied to accommodate different stages of deployments and target audiences. Each project requires unique access control configurations. The central IT team needs to have access to all projects. Furthermore, data from Cloud Storage buckets and BigQuery datasets must be shared for use in other projects in an ad hoc way. You want to simplify access control management by minimizing the number of policies. Which two steps should you take? (Choose two.)</p>

<p>Your company is in the process of migrating its on-premises data warehousing solutions to BigQuery. The existing data warehouse uses trigger-based change data capture (CDC) to apply updates from multiple transactional database sources on a daily basis. With BigQuery, your company hopes to improve its handling of CDC so that changes to the source systems are available to query in BigQuery in near-real time using log-based CDC streams, while also optimizing for the performance of applying changes to the data warehouse. Which two steps should they take to ensure that changes are available in the BigQuery reporting table with minimal latency while reducing compute overhead? (Choose two.)</p>
<ul class="checklist">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" data-question="1" data-content="0" /> A. Perform a DML INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to replicate each individual CDC record in real time directly on the reporting table.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" data-question="0" data-content="1" /> B. Insert each new CDC record and corresponding operation type to a'staging table in real time.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" data-question="1" data-content="0" /> C. Periodically DELETE outdated records from the reporting table.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" data-question="0" data-content="1" /> D: Periodically use a DML MERGE to perform several DML INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations at the same time on the reporting table.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" data-question="1" data-content="0" /> E. Insert each new CDC record and corresponding operation type in real time to the reporting table, and use a materialized view to expose only the newest version of each unique record.</label></li>

<p>The marketing team at your organization provides regular updates of a segment of your customer dataset. The marketing team has given you a CSV with 1 million records that must be updated in BigQuery. When you use the UPDATE statement in BigQuery, you receive a quotaExceeded error. What should you do?</p>
<ul class="radio-list">
<li><label><input type="radio" data-question="1" data-content="0" /> A. Reduce the number of records updated each day to stay within the BigQuery UPDATE DML statement limit.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="radio" data-question="1" data-content="0" /> B. Increase the BigQuery UPDATE DML statement limit in the Quota management section of the Google Cloud Platform Console.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="radio" data-question="0" data-content="1" /> C. Split the source CSV file into smaller CSV files in Cloud Storage to reduce the number of BigQuery UPDATE DML statements per BigQuery job.</label></li>
<li>( ) D. Import the new records from the CSV file into a new BigQuery table. Create a BigQuery job that merges the new records with the existing records and writes the
results to a new BigQuery table.</li>
